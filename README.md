### DeepLink Helper

This app intends to help Android developers who want to test how the apps they develop handle deep links. While we have some ways to do this, like Android Studio run configurations or push notifications, I found some limitations to those. Run configurations in Android Studio don't allow me to test how an app that's already open handles a deep link, and sending push notifications can be a hassle.

This helper app comes with persistent storage, showing your latest URIs at the top, and clicking on a suggestion fills in the text box for you to easily update the URI if necessary. 

I hope you find this helpful! If you have any requests, please submit an issue. :) 

### Sample

I purposely put in some URIs that wouldn't work, both to show the error but also just to demonstrate how the functionality works.
